My brother requested that I make this for him so I am going to interrupt my other projects until this is at a usable state.

What he wants:

You can save your recipes into the app, then once a week pick out the meals you want to prepare and it will create a shopping list for you with all of the ingredients from the recipes.

Additional requirements after some questions and clarifications:

- It would be great if you can open a copy of the cooking instructions as a PDF
- The ingredients should be sorted by category because that is how they are found in a grocery store.
- Duplicate ingredients are combined
- Ingredient amounts are either by weight or by volume
- If a duplicate ingredient is listed by weight and another by volume, they are listed separately instead of being combined
- It need to accept both US and metric units
- It would be cool if you could share your recipes with friends

New requirements discovered while working
- Ingredient amounts can also be by item count, such as 3 eggs
